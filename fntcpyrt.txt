Regarding copyright on font data in GRAFTABL.COM and CPI files
==============================================================

  In the United States, fonts are not copyrightable, though the vector data
  used to generate them can be copyrighted (e.g., TTFs, OTFs).  In most other
  countries, if there is a copyright on fonts or typefaces, they are generally
  limited to 25 years or less.  This font data dates back at least to 1987
  (release of PC DOS 3.3).
  
  It is my belief that, my sampling of the data from Windows 95 in 2000
  notwithstanding, I am not violating any laws in the US or in most countries
  by including this bitmap data in the necessary files.
